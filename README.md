Welcome to your personalized home library! In this app you can keep track of all the books you own and the authors whose work you possess.

As this app possesses both the backend and frontend, this is the only repo that you'll need to download! 

Once you've forked & cloned this repository, open the file. To start the app, you'll `cd backend` and then `rails s` to get the Rails API up and running on its own server. In a second terminal (I like to split mine in half), `cd frontend` and open `index.html` in your browser. Once you've followed these steps, you should see your personalized home library up and running!

Changes to the database that you make will persist, so don't worry about losing your data if you come back at a later date. You can navigate through authors and click on them to see the list of books they've written; from there, you can give them a new book which will automatically show up in your book list.s

Once you're done using the app, make sure you `CTRL+C` in the terminal that's running your Rails server to shut it down.
